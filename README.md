# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD, you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo) or Battle.net. Alternatively, you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/latest/download/spawn.mpq) [[2]](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or Diablo installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion, you will also need to copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, and `hfvoice.mpq`.

For more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).
